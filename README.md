### Project Description

Introducing, [Tagger](http://tagger-fe.herokuapp.com/)! A new email client that takes the process of searching for emails effortless with a smart search functionality that expands a greater scope so our client can find what they want faster. With our client, we are more streamlined because we have better parameters for our search and isn't an exact word match like most email clients.

Logged into our email client, our users are able to read and respond to their emails, from a multitude of email services.

This email client allows users to attend to all their emails within one email  tool, enabling user to remain productive while answering emails from their many email serviers.
